//! Platform secrets supplied through the server's environment.
//!
//! An operator can hand the server any number of named secrets at start by
//! setting `TEMPER_SECRET_<NAME>` variables. Each one with a non-empty value
//! becomes the platform secret `<name>` in lower case: `TEMPER_SECRET_BUILD_TOKEN`
//! supplies `build_token`. A platform secret is the baseline for every tenant;
//! a tenant's own stored secret of the same name overrides it for that tenant.
//!
//! `<NAME>` is one or more of `A` to `Z`, `0` to `9` and `_`, starting with a
//! letter, so that no two variables can supply the same secret. A variable
//! that does not fit, or whose value is larger than the secrets API accepts,
//! is skipped and reported by name. Values are never reported. A name the
//! server already holds a platform secret for is left as it is, so what the
//! server sets for itself at start wins.
//!
//! A seeded secret is read like any other secret a tenant can read: a
//! module's `get_secret` call needs a policy that permits `access_secret` on
//! it, and a `{secret:<name>}` template in an integration config is resolved
//! without that check. Supply this way only what every tenant's specs may use.
//!
//! Nothing here reads the process environment or writes to storage: the
//! caller passes the variables in, and the secrets live in the vault's
//! in-memory platform layer only.
